# Breakout

A simple 2D game based on the 1976 [Atari game](https://atari.com/pages/breakout) and following the breakout game [learnopengl tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout). This project is built using C++ and OpenGL and serves as a demonstration of basic game development concepts such as rendering, input handling, and game logic. The boilerplate code is forked from [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter), which provides a simple OpenGL setup and window management along with a CMake configuration linking a handful of useful libraries for OpenGL graphics and basic game development.

## Getting Started (mostly copied from Glitter's Readme)

This project has a single dependency: [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/), which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files. Start by cloning this repository, making sure to pass the `--recursive` flag to grab all the dependencies. If you forgot, then you can `git submodule update --init` instead.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mackcooper1408/Breakout
cd Breakout
cd Build
```

Now generate a project file or makefile for your platform. If you want to use a particular IDE, make sure it is installed; don't forget to set the Start-Up Project in Visual Studio or the Target in Xcode.

```bash
# UNIX Makefile
cmake ..

# Mac OSX
cmake -G "Xcode" ..

# Microsoft Windows
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14" ..
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..
...
```
